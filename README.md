# transport mode detection
Reaching state of the art accuracy in transport mode detection using XGboost as classifier and geolife dataset (a Microsoft project) as ground truth


## Files
This notebook can be executed downloading the original microsoft geolife dataset (from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52367&from=https%3A%2F%2Fresearch.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdownloads%2Fb16d359d-d164-469e-9fd4-daa38f2b2e13%2F)

There are other 4 auxiliary datasets, they contains locations of POI (points of interest) in the area of Beijing. These have been created and downloaded from the online interface of overpass turbo (https://overpass-turbo.eu), so the data are extracted from OpenStreetMap. These dataset are not necessary to run part of the code and calibrate the classifierm but can improve the performances.
